# flight-price-prediction

Flight price prediction is a dynamic field that harnesses the power of data analysis and machine learning to anticipate fluctuations in airfare. This sophisticated approach involves the utilization of historical pricing data, seasonal patterns, and diverse influencing factors to construct predictive models. By discerning patterns and trends, these models provide valuable insights into potential changes in flight prices, empowering travelers and industry professionals alike to make informed decisions. As a result, individuals can strategically plan their journeys, taking advantage of optimal pricing windows and avoiding potential spikes. The continuous refinement of these predictive models, often incorporating real-time data, contributes to the evolution of more accurate and responsive systems in the ever-changing landscape of air travel pricing.

I extend my appreciation to Aarya M S for her pivotal role in ensuring the triumphant realization of this project
