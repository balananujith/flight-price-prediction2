# Flight-Price-Prediction

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a web application using Python for predicting flight fares. The application provides users with the anticipated cost of air travel based on specified details such as departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, number of stoppages, and the chosen airline carrier.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

When purchasing airline tickets, the traditional advice is to secure them well in advance to avoid sudden price increases before the departure date. However, airlines may strategically lower prices to stimulate sales, challenging the conventional wisdom. Flight ticket costs are influenced by factors such as holiday seasons, seat availability, and temporal considerations, with some pricing variables undisclosed. Travelers seek the best day for ticket purchases, while airlines focus on optimizing overall revenue, making timing a critical consideration.

- **Flexibility in Pricing**: Airlines have the freedom to adjust ticket prices, offering opportunities for cost-conscious travelers to save money by timing their purchases strategically.
- **Dynamic Pricing Factors**: Flight ticket prices involve a complex interplay of observable factors like holiday schedules and seat availability, alongside undisclosed variables known only to the airlines.
- **Algorithmic Decision-Making**: The central challenge lies in developing algorithms that analyze historical and current flight prices for a specific departure date, enabling informed decisions about when to make ticket purchases.
