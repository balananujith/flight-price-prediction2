# Flight-Price-Prediction

**Objective:**

In this endeavor, our objective is to create a web application using Python for predicting flight fares. The application will provide users with the anticipated cost of air travel based on specified details such as departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, number of stoppages, and the chosen airline carrier.

**Problem Statement ❓**

When it comes to buying airline tickets, the traditional advice is to secure them well in advance to mitigate the risk of sudden price increases before the departure date. However, this strategy doesn't always hold true, as airlines may opt to lower prices strategically to stimulate sales. Flight ticket costs are influenced by various factors, such as holiday seasons, seat availability, and temporal considerations, with some pricing variables remaining undisclosed. As travelers aim to identify the best day for ticket purchases, airlines are focused on optimizing overall revenue, making the timing of purchases a critical consideration.

**Flexibility in Pricing**: Airlines have the freedom to adjust ticket prices at any given time, presenting an opportunity for cost-conscious travelers to save money by timing their purchases strategically.
Dynamic Pricing Factors: The determination of flight ticket prices involves a complex interplay of observable factors like holiday schedules and seat availability, alongside undisclosed variables known only to the airlines.
**Algorithmic Decision-Making**: The central challenge lies in developing algorithms that can analyze both historical and current flight prices for a specific departure date, enabling travelers to make informed decisions about when to make their ticket purchases.

**🧑‍💻 🧑‍🎓 User Interface**

**App Functionality**

**Fare Prediction:** This repository focuses on predicting flight ticket prices, offering users the ability to estimate fare costs based on input travel details like dates, cities, stopovers, and airline choice.

**Machine Learning Model:** Leveraging a machine learning model trained on historical flight data, the project utilizes patterns from past flights to enhance the accuracy of fare predictions.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The application boasts a user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users to input travel information and obtain accurate fare predictions.

**Predictive Accuracy:** The primary goal is to provide precise fare predictions, empowering travelers to plan and budget effectively by considering various factors influencing ticket prices.

**Customizable Inputs:** Users enjoy flexibility in tailoring inputs, including details such as stopovers and airline carriers, for personalized and accurate fare predictions.

**Continuous Improvement:** The project incorporates mechanisms for ongoing improvement and refinement, staying updated with the latest flight data to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Open Source Collaboration:** Being a repository, the project welcomes contributions from the open-source community, fostering collaboration for improvements and additional features.


**Scalability:** The project is designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling increased data volume and user requests as more individuals utilize the fare prediction tool.

**Integration Possibilities:** Depending on scope, there may be opportunities for integration with other travel-related applications or services, enriching the overall travel planning experience for users.
